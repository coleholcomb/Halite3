## Next Steps
* Better depositing conversion
* Other ship types
* Implement dropoffs

## Version History
* botv14 (final)
  * fixed bug in cell scoring around dropoffs
  * adjusted 4p dropoff locations
  * added untested inspiration boosting in 4p
  * increased cluster affinity in 4p
  * created "fast" move for mining ships when timeouts are on the line
  * changed 4p ship spawning strategy
* botv13drop
  * rudimentary dropoff spawning
* botv12
  * 2p enemy crashing strategy
  * linear cluster score scaling
* botv11
  * 4p depositing ships no longer crash into enemies.
* botv10
  * Simple 4p crash detection
* botv9
  * Cluster scoring = 0.5
* botv8
  * Increased time efficiency, fixed game_update timing bug
* botv7
  * Fixed bug where mining ship gets stuck on shipyard
  * Changed deposit converstion condition to 0.95
* botv6
  * Depositing ships now use A* -> less clumping
  * v5 - 32: 5/5, 40: 8/2, 48: 6/4
* botv5
  * Dropoff blocking defense
  * Prioritize cells that can be reached in mining cell selection
  * Mining ships avoid depositing paths with 100 halite heuristic
* botv4
  * Dijkstra based pathfinding and cell scoring for mining
  * Dijkstra based pathfinding for depositing
* botv3
  * Changed mining->deposit converstion minimum to 85% capacity
* botv2
  * Change mining->deposit converstion minimum to 66% capacity 
  * Reversed order of mining and depositing commands for more efficient deposition
  * Role swapping (depositing -> mining) is performed prior to command loop
* botv1
  * Basic role assignment
  * Primitive mining selection
  * Naive deposit
